    <div id="main_text">Coincise allows users of all ages to effectively budget their finances. People with poor financial management skills may have difficulty purchasing a home, a car, or any other aspiration. Coincise assists users in identifying strategies that will enable them to achieve their objectives.
        The primary goals of Coincise are centralized on the benefits of all that choose to use the new app. We strive to enhance the experiences of new users through our attempts to educate the public on personal finance. Another very important goal of ours is to help those in financial hardships manage their money. Specifically, this will help them understand how much money they should set aside for savings, pocket-spending, and essentials/taxes.
        Lastly, due to our budget app's highly innovative features, any user can easily find success in a short period of time. The app allows the user to receive instant financial advice, which leads to better overall money management. The app is designed to be useful/impactful to people of all ages, and we are competing with accountants who may be costly to hire. Coincise will be available at a low cost when it is released proving itself to be a cheaper alternative to hiring an accountant. For these various reasons, Coincise proves to be a cut above the rest. </div>
